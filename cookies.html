<h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
<p>
  Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile

  owners. Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Finops Experts) are
  called “first-party cookies.” Cookies set by parties other than the website
  owner are called “third-party cookies.”

  them or they expire). Below are some categories of cookies that may be used
  on our Site:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These are necessary for our Site to

    <strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong> These enable enhanced functionality
    and personalization, such as remembering choices you make (like language

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Targeting and Advertising Cookies:</strong> These cookies may be
    set through our Site by our advertising partners to build a profile of your
    interests and show you relevant ads on other websites. They do not store
    directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your
    browser and device.
